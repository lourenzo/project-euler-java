# Project Euler - Java Streams

My implementations of solutions for the problems in Project Euler, as I am
coding it along with my teammates at CAA.

## Development process

The approach here is quite straightforward, first catching the concepts and the central point of thge problem,
then implementing optimizations using known concepts, then implementing libraries to enable future fastest and
optimized solutions.

## To-Do

- [ ] Build a stream-efficient Prime number detection library
- [ ] Add a time efficiency calculating library
